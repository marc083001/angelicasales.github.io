	<p><b><font size="50">Nacpan Beach, El Nido</font></b><br><br>
 		El Nido in Palawan is most famous for its paradise-like islands and lagoons, but a 45-minute ride from its main town takes you to another idyllic destination:
 		<br>Nacpan Beach. Island hopping escapades in El Nido, including a visit to El Nido Big Lagoon and other top Palawan beaches should not be missed. 
 		<br>But after a jam-packed day of visiting coves, white-sand beaches in El Nido, limestone cliffs, and other El Nido Palawan tourist spots, a trip to relaxing Nacpan Beach is highly recommended. </p>

 	<p><b><font size="50">Mayon Volcano, Albay, Bicol</font></b><br><br>
 		One of the top natural landmarks in the Philippines and one of the most-visited tourist spots in Albay, it is already a wonderful experience seeing the volcano from afar. 
 		<br>But if you are an adrenaline junkie, you can soak up all its beauty while gliding through a zipline in Lignon Hill or going on a Mayon Volcano tour via a Mayon ATV ride in Bicol. 
 		<br>Visit the Cagsawa Ruins for another unique and historic viewing point of the Mayon Volcano. As a bonus, from Legazpi, you can take a side trip to Donsol, 
 		<br>where you can enjoy swimming with whale sharks in their natural habitat.</p>

 	<p><b><font size="50">Banaue Rice Terraces, Ifugao</b><br><br></font>
 		Hand-chiseled some 2,000 years ago, the Banaue Rice Terraces in Banaue of Ifugao, North Luzon, is a remarkable destination and is truly one of the most beautiful places in the 
 		<br>Philippines and regarded as one of the Philippines' iconic landmarks. Sit in a colorful jeepney as it cruises along winding roads in Banaue, and views of dramatic mud-walled rice terraces leave you in awe. 
 		<br>The Ifugao people were highly skilled in carving both wood and mountainsides. The Banaue Rice Terraces is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
 		<br>It offers spectacular views of emerald hues during the rice-growing seasons of April-May and October-November.Banaue and its many natural attractions may pack a 
 		<br>lot of tourists so you can make your way further to quieter Batad Rice Terraces and take a quick dip at its mighty Tappiya waterfalls. 
 		<br>You can also explore nearby Baguio City or pick fresh strawberries in La Trinidad, Benguet.
