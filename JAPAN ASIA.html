 		With flowers emerging after a cold winter, spring represents “new beginnings” in Japan (including the school year, which starts in April). 
 		<br>The first sakura, or cherry blossom, appears in the southern islands, and the phenomenon moves its way northwards. 
		<br>There are over 600 types of sakura trees across the country with varying shades of pink. Petals gradually unfold outwards until reaching their peak mankai (full bloom) for a mere few days.</p>
